1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
there's more seats on this side

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for people walking in late. So just to make sure you're in cs231n deep

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
learning neural network class for visual recognition. Anybody in the

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:39,000
wrong class? Welcome, happy new year happy first day of  
winter break. This class CS231n is the second offering

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
of this class We have literally doubled our enrolment from 180 people last  
time we offered to

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
about 350 of you signed up. Just a couple of words to make us all legally

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
covered, we are video recording this class. So, you know, if you're

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
uncomfortable about this for today just go behind that camera or go to the

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
corner where the camera's not gonna turn but we are going to send out forms  
for you to fill out in terms

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of allowing video recording so that's just one bit of housekeeping so

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, so my name is Fei-Fei Li, I'm a professor at the computer science  
department

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So this class I'm co-teaching with two senior graduate students and one of  
them

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
is here. He's Andrej Karpathy. Andrej can you just say hi to everybody we  
have what I don't think Andrej needs too much

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
introduction all of probably know his work

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
follow his blog his Twitter follower

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Andrej has way more followers than I do. He's very popular (laughter) And  
also Justin Johnson who is still

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
travelling internationally but will be back in a few days so Andre and  
Justin so

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
will be picking up the bulk of the lecture teaching Today I'll be giving

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the first lecture but as you probably can see that I'm expecting the  
new-born very soon

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
speaking of weeks so you'll see more of undrained Justin in lecture time we  
will

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
also introduce a whole team of TAs towards the end of this lecture. Again

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
people who are looking for seats, if you go out of that door and come back,  
there's

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
a whole bunch of seats on the side. So for this lecture we're going to

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
give the introduction of the class what kind of problems we work on and the

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
tools we'll be learning so again welcome to CS231n this is a vision

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
class it's based on a very specific modelling architecture called neural

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
network and even more specifically mostly on convolution neural network and  
a lot

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
of you hear this term maybe through a popular press article or 

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
coverage we tend to call this the deep learning network Vision is one of  
the fastest growing field of

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
artificial intelligence. In fact CISCO has estimated and 

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
(we are on day 4 of this) by 2016, which we already have arrived, more than  
85% of

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the internet cyberspace data is in the form of pixels

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
or what they call multimedia so we basically have entered an age of vision

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of images and videos. And why is this so? while partly to a large extent

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is because of the explosion of both the Internet as a carrier of data as  
well as

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
sensors. we have more sensors that the number of people on Earth these days

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
every one of you is carrying some kind of smart phones, digital cameras and

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you know cars around on the street with cameras so the sensors

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
have really enabled the explosion of visual data on the internet but visual

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
data or pixel data is also the hardest data to harness so if you have heard  
my

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:07,000
previous talks and some other computer vision professors we call this  
the dark matter of the Internet

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
why is this the dark matter just like the universe is consisted of 85% dark

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
matter dark energy is these matters that energy that is very hard to  
observe 

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we can infer it by mathematical models in the universe, on the internet  
these are the

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
matters pixel data are the data that we don't know we have a hard time

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
grasping the contents Here's one very very simple specs for you to consider

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
so today

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
YouTube servers for every 60 seconds will have more than 150 hours of  
videos uploaded

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
onto YouTube servers for every 60 seconds

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
think about the amount of data there is no way that human eyes can sift  
through

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
this massive amount of data and make annotations

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
labelling it and describe the contents Think from the

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
perspective of the YouTube team or Google company if they want to help us

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to search, index, manage and of course for their purpose put

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
advertisement or whatever manipulate the content of the data were at a loss

57
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because nobody can hand annotate this The only hope we can do this is  
through vision

58
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
technology, to be able to label the objects find the things, find the  
frames

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you know locate where basketball video were Kobe Bryant's making like that

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
awesome shot and so these are the problems we are facing today that the

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
massive amount of data and the challenges of the dark matter so

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
computer vision as a field that touches upon many other fields of

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
studies so I am sure that even sitting here

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
many of you come from computer science but many of you come from biology  
psychology

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
are specializing in natural language processing or graphics or robotics or

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
or you know medical imaging and so on so as a field computer vision is  
really a

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
truly interdisciplinary field what the problems we work on the models we  
use

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
touches engineering physics biology psychology computer science and  
mathematics

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
so just a little bit of a more personal touch I am the director of the  
computer vision

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
lab at Stanford in our lab, I work with graduate students and postdocs and  
even

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
undergraduate students on the number of topics and most dear to our own  
research

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
who some of them you know Andrej, Justin come from my lab

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
number of TAs come from my lab we work on machine learning which is part

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
a superset of deep learning we work a lot cognitive science and  
neuroscience as well

75
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
as the intersection between an NLP and speech so that's the kind of

76
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
landscape of computer vision research that my lab works in. So also to put  
things

77
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in a little more perspective what other computer vision classes now we  
offer

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
here at Stanford through the computer science department are clearly you're  
in

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
this class CS231n so you some of you who have never taken computer vision

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
probably heard of computer vision for the first time probably should have  
already

81
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
done cs131 that's a intro class of previous quarter we offer and then and

82
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
then next quarter which normally is offered this quarter but this year as a

83
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
little shifted there is an important graduate-level computer vision class

84
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
called cs231a offered by professor Silvio Savarese who works in robotic

85
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:47,000
3d vision and a lot of you ask us the question that do these replace each  
other this class CS231n

86
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
vs CS231a and the answer is no. if you're interested in a broader

87
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
coverage of tools and topics of computer vision as well as some of the

88
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
fundamental topics that come that relate you to 3D vision, robotic vision

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and visual recognition you should consider taking in 231a that is the

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
more general class 231n which we'll go into starting today more deeply  
focuses

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
on a specific angle of both problem and model Model is neural network and  
the

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
angle is visual recognition mostly but of course they have a little bit of

93
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
overlap but that's the major difference And next quarter we also have  
possibly

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
a couple of advanced seminar level class but that's still in the

95
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
formation stage so you just have to check the syllabus so that's the kind  
of computer

96
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
vision curricula we offer this year at Stanford. Any question so far? yes

97
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is CS131 a strict requirement for this class? CS131 is not a strict  
requirement for this class but you'll soon see that if you've

98
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
never heard of computer vision for the first time I suggest you find a way  
to

99
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
catch up because this class has assumes a basic level of understanding of

100
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
computer vision you can browse the notes and so on.

101
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A rest of today is that I will give a very brief broad stroke history of  
computer vision

102
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and then we'll talk about 231 and a little bit in terms of the organization

103
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of the class I actually really care about sharing with you this brief  
history of computer

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
vision because you know you might be here primarily because of your  
interest

105
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
in this really interesting tool called deep learning and this is the  
purpose of this class

106
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We are offering you an in-depth look and then

107
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and just journey through what this deep learning model is but without

108
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
understanding the problem domain without thinking deeply about what this  
problem is 

109
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's very hard for you to go on to be an inventor of the next model that

110
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
really solve the big problem in vision or to be you know developing,

111
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
making impactful work in solving a hard problem and also in general problem

112
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
domain and model the modeling tools themselves are never never fully

113
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
decoupled

114
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They inform each other and you'll see through the history of deep learning  
a little

115
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
bit that the convolutional neural network architecture come from the need  
to solve

116
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
a vision problem

117
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then, vision problem helps the deep learning algorithm to evolve and 

118
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
back and forth so is really important to you know I want you to finish this  
course and

119
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
feel proud that you're student of computer vision and of deep learning so  
you

120
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
have this both the toolset and the in-depth understanding of how to use the

121
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
toolset to tackle important problems so it's a brief history but

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,000
doesn't mean it's short history so we're gonna go all the way back to 

123
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
540 million years ago so why did I picked this you know on the scale

124
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:09,000
of Earth history this is a fairly specific range of years while so I don't

125
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
know if you have heard of this but this is a very very curious period of  
the

126
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Earth's history biologists call this the big bang of evolution Before 

127
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
540 million years ago

128
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the Earth is a very peaceful of its pretty big pond of water so we have  
very simple organisms

129
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:46,000
these are like animals that just floats in the water and the way they eat  
and hang out on

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
a daily basis is you know they float and if some kind of food comes by near

131
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
their mouth or whatever they just open their mouths grabbed it and we don't

132
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
have too many different types of animals. But something really strange  
happened around 540

133
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
million years suddenly from the fossils we study there's a huge explosion  
of species

134
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
biologist call speciation like suddenly for some reason something hit the  
earth that animal

135
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
start to diversify and they got really complex they really start to have

136
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
predators and preys and they have all kind of tools to survive what was

137
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the triggering force of those was a huge question because people were  
saying 'Oh you know'

138
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
'another meteoroid hit the earth' or or you know 'the environment

139
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
changed' It turned out one of the most convincing theory is by this guy  
called

140
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Andrew Parker

141
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
he's a modern zoologist in Australia from Australia he studied a lot the

142
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,000
fossils and he's theory is that it was the onset of the eyes so one of the  
first

143
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
trilobites developed an eye, a really really simple eye it's almost like a

144
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
pinhole camera that just catches light and make some projections and

145
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
registers some information from the environment

146
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
suddenly life is no longer so mellow, because once you have the eye, the  
first

147
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
thing you can do is you could go catch food you actually know where food  
it's

148
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
you're not just like blind and floating in the water and once you can go  
catch food

149
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
guess what the food better develop eyes and to run away from you otherwise

150
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
they'll be gone you know so the first of all who had had eyes were

151
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
like in an unlimited buffet, its like working at Google (laughter) and it's  
just like they have the best time eating

152
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
everything they can but because those are onset of the eyes what we what  
the

153
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:28,000
zoologist realized is the biological arms race begin every single animal  
needs to

154
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
needs to learn to develop things to survive or to you know you 


155
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
suddenly have preys and predators and all this and the speciation begin so  
that's

156
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
when vision begun 540 million years and not only vision begun vision was  
one

157
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
of the major driving force of the speciation or that the big bang of

158
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
evolution so we're not gonna follow evolution with too much detail

159
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
another big important work that focus on the engineering of vision happened  
around

160
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the Renaissance and of course it's attributed to this amazing guy Leonardo  
da Vinci so before

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Renaissance you know throughout human civilization from Asia to Europe to

171
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
India to Arabic world we have seen models of cameras so Aristotle has

172
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
proposed the camera through the leaves, Chinese philosopher ?? have  
proposed

173
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the camera through a box with the hole but

174
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
if you look at the first documentation really modern looking camera it's  
called

175
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
camera obscura

176
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and that is documented by Leonardo da Vinci I'm not gonna get into the  
details

177
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but this is you know you get the idea that there is some kind of a lens or  
at least a hole to 

178
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
capture light reflected from the real world and then there is some kind of

179
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
projection to capture the information of the real-world image so

180
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that's the beginning of the modern you know engineering of

181
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
vision it started with wanting to copy the world and wanting to make a copy  
of

182
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the visual world it hasn't got anywhere close to wanting to engineer the

183
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
understanding of the visual world right now we're just talking about  
duplicating

184
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the visual world so that's one important work to remember and of course  
after

185
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
camera obscura we start to see a whole series of successful,

186
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
some film gets developed you know like kodak was one of the first

187
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
companies developing commercial cameras and then we start to have  
camcorders and

188
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and all this Another very important piece of work that I want you

189
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to be aware of as vision student is actually not a engineering work but

190
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
a science, piece of science work that's starting to ask the question

191
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
is "how does vision work in our biological brain ?" you know we

192
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
we now know that it took 540 million years of evolution to get a really

193
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
fantastic visual system in mammals and humans but what did evolution do  
during this time

194
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what kind of architecture did develop from that simple trilobite eye to  
today

195
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
yours and mine while very important piece of work happened at Harvard by

196
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
two at that time two young two very young ambitious postdocs

197
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hubel and Wiesel what they did is that they used awake but anaesthetized  
cats and then

198
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
there was enough technology to build this little needle called electrode to  
push the

199
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
electrons through to (the skull is open) into the brain of the cat

200
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
into an area what we already know called primary visual cortex.

201
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
primary visual cortex is a area where neurons do a lot of things for visual  
processing but before

202
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hubel and Wiesel we don't really know what primary visual cortex is doing  
we just know it's

203
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
one of the earliest stage other than you eyes of course but earliest stage  
for visual

204
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
processing then there is tons and tons of neurons working on vision then we

205
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
really ought to know what this is because that's the beginning of vision,

206
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
visual process in the brain so they put this electrode into the primary

207
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
visual cortex and an interestingly this is another interesting fact if I  
don't all drop my

208
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
stuff I'll show you primary visual cortex the first stage or the second,  
depending on where you come from, I'm being

209
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
very very rough here, first stage of your cortical visual processing stage  
is

210
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
in the back of your brain not near your eye it's very interesting because

211
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
your olfactory cortical processing is right

212
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
behind your nose, your auditory is right behind your ear but your primary
